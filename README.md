# leafLet-challenge

## About
This repository is for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp Leaflet challenge homework.

In this project, I used Leaflet and D3 in javascript to build an interactive map that includes markers for every earthquake in the past 7 days. This data is sourced from the USGS website. Markers are sized by earthquake magnitude and colored by earthquake depth. I included a legend and several different basemaps that can be selected by the user.

I also added in an overlay of the tectonic plate boundaries to help illustrate the relationship between earthquak location and tectonic plate boundaries.

Additonally, Each marker includes a popup when selected that provides the location, depth, magnitude, date and time of the earthquake.

No surprise, but it is reinforcing to see how well the earthquakes align with the tectonic plate boundaries.
